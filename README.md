First Project | Basic Layout Project (2023)

One of my earliest projects, created using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. 
Built in 2023, this project demonstrates a simple layout without a structured organization, 
aimed at practicing foundational web development skills.

Features:
Basic HTML and CSS usage
Simple JavaScript effects
Unstructured project files, reflecting an early stage of learning

Goal: A snapshot of my initial steps in learning layout design, focusing on foundational HTML, CSS, and experimenting with JavaScript.
